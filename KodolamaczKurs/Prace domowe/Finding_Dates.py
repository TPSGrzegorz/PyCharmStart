TEXT = """In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry 
with the Soviet Union.[14] On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite. 
This surprise success fired fears and imaginations around the world. It demonstrated that the Soviet Union had the 
capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances, and challenged American claims of military, 
economic and technological superiority.[15] This precipitated the Sputnik crisis, and triggered the Space Race.[16] 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded to the Sputnik challenge by creating the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA), and initiating Project Mercury,[17] which aimed to launch a man into Earth orbit.[18] But on 
April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space, and the first to orbit the Earth.[19] 
Nearly a month later, on May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American in space, completing a 15-minute 
suborbital journey. After being recovered from the Atlantic Ocean, he received a congratulatory telephone call from 
Eisenhower's successor, John F. Kennedy.[20] 

Since the Soviet Union had higher lift capacity launch vehicles, Kennedy chose, from among options presented by NASA, 
a challenge beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry, so that the US and Soviet Union would be 
starting from a position of equality. A crewed mission to the Moon would serve this purpose.[21] 

On May 25, 1961, Kennedy addressed the United States Congress on "Urgent National Needs" and declared:

I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade [1960s] is out, of landing 
a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more 
impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or 
expensive to accomplish. We propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft. We propose to 
develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters, much larger than any now being developed, until certain which is 
superior. We propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned explorationsâexplorations which 
are particularly important for one purpose which this nation will never overlook: the survival of the man who first 
makes this daring flight. But in a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the Moonâif we make this 
judgment affirmatively, it will be an entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there. ââKennedy's speech 
to Congress[22] 

On September 12, 1962, Kennedy delivered another speech before a crowd of about 40,000 people in the Rice University 
football stadium in Houston, Texas.[23][24] A widely quoted refrain from the middle portion of the speech reads as 
follows: 

Kennedy, in a blue suit and tie, speaks at a wooden podium bearing the seal of the President of the United States. 
Vice President Lyndon Johnson and other dignitaries stand behind him. President John F. Kennedy speaking at Rice 
University on September 12, 1962 There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its 
hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful 
cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, 
why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas? 

We choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the Moon ... We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the 
other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and 
measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are 
unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too. """
